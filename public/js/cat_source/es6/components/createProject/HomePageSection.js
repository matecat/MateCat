              Matecat employs cutting-edge AI to help translators save time and
              deliver their best quality. Consistent terminology is guaranteed
              by matching words in all their forms, ensuring that translators
              never miss glossary terms. Large Language Models help translators
              with unfamiliar terms by providing context-specific definitions.
              Locale-specific checks on punctuation, numbers, dates and other
              conventions make sure that translators can work without worrying
              about accidental slip-ups.

              Get top-quality machine translation matches in 200+ languages with
              Matecat's free adaptive machine translation provided by ModernMT.
              It's like a smart assistant that gets better as you go, saving you
              tons of time. For each segment, it checks previous translations to
              find similar sentences and then adjusts the result based on your
              past work. What's more, it learns from your translations on the
              fly and takes into account the context of the whole document to
              make sure it uses the correct style and terminology.
