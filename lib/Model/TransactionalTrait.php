/**
 * Trait TransactionalTrait
 *
 * This trait is intended for use in classes that interact with database transactions.
 *
 * The class using this trait may not be aware of an ongoing transaction, so
 * it should not call `beginTransaction` if a transaction is already open.
 *
 * Additionally, it should not call `commitTransaction` if it did not initiate the transaction itself.
 *
 * It is assumed that the surrounding code will handle committing the larger transaction.
 *
